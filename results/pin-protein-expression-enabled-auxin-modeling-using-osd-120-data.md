# PIN protein expression enabled Auxin modeling using OSD-120 data

### Relevance of Skewing Data in Plant Research

The discussion on skewing data in ABRS & VEGGIE systems raises important questions about the interpretation of plant growth experiments and the need for careful analysis to avoid misleading conclusions. A compelling study published in 2021 on cytokinins provides important insights into their role in plant biology, augmenting our understanding of plant growth regulators. This, combined with the discussed resources, offers a comprehensive view of current trends and discoveries in plant science. These findings underscore the complexity of plant responses to environmental stresses and the critical roles of various transporters and regulators in these processes. The continuous advances in RNAseq techniques and bioinformatics provide deeper insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying plant adaptations, paving the way for innovative strategies in agriculture and plant biology.

**Describe Auxin Transport modelling:** Our modelling experiment revealed that the PIN transporters are important for adaptation and development of Arabidopsis in spaceflight conditions and show that auxin distribution patterns may help explain physiological phenotypes observed during light. We found that the distribution of auxin in wild-type Arabidopsis (WS) resembles that of the Col-0 _phyD_ mutant during the CARA mission, as described by Paul et al. (2015). Our mathematical modelling revealed that this similarity in auxin distribution patterns is responsible for the observed changes in growth patterns.

**Description of root shape modelling:** Adjusting the sensitivity settings for tropism within the Archidart modelling software indicates that alterations in root skew and waving can be initiated by reducing thigmo-tropism sensitivity. This finding suggests a potential correlation between environmental stressors, such as hypoxic conditions, and a decrease in thigmo-tropic sensitivity in plants. Our modelling results, in conjunction with observational data from plants cultivated in agar dishes on the International Space Station (ISS), support this hypothesis, providing valuable insight into the adaptive responses of plants to stress conditions.

In Arabidopsis thaliana Columbia-0 (Col-0) wild-type, it has been observed that environmental factors enhance the expression of the PIN-FORMED2 (PIN2) gene, playing a critical role in auxin transport. However, in the absence of PIN3 and PIN7 in the columella cells, there is a disruption in the transport of auxin and other hormones to the epidermis. This observation indicates that PIN3 and PIN7 are essential for the proper distribution of auxin within the plant. Moreover, under conditions of microgravity, the expression of PIN3 and PIN7 is notably suppressed, leading to the confinement of auxin within the Quiescent Center (QC) region. This spatial limitation of auxin is further evidenced by the reduced and more concentrated expression of the DR5::GUS reporter, a known auxin response marker, within the QC. Additionally, the expression of ARABIDOPSIS RESPONSE REGULATOR5 (ARR5), a cytokinin response reporter, is diminished during flight, suggesting altered hormone signaling in microgravity. This evidence collectively highlights the critical role of PIN proteins in the spatial regulation of hormone transport and signaling, specifically under varied environmental conditions.
