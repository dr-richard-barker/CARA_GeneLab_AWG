# PIN protein expression enabled Auxin modeling using OSD-120 data

### Relevance of Skewing Data in Plant Research

The discussion on skewing data in ABRS & VEGGIE systems raises important questions about the interpretation of plant growth experiments and the need for careful analysis to avoid misleading conclusions. A compelling study published in 2021 on cytokinins provides important insights into their role in plant biology, augmenting our understanding of plant growth regulators. This, combined with the discussed resources, offers a comprehensive view of current trends and discoveries in plant science. These findings underscore the complexity of plant responses to environmental stresses and the critical roles of various transporters and regulators in these processes. The continuous advances in RNAseq techniques and bioinformatics are providing deeper insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying plant adaptations, paving the way for innovative strategies in agriculture and plant biology.

**Describe Auxin Transport modelling:** Our modeling experiment revealed that the PIN transporters are important for adaptation and development of Arabidopsis in spaceflight conditions and show that auxin distribution patterns may help explain physiological phenotypes observed during light. We found that the distribution of auxin in wild-type Arabidopsis (WS) resembles that of the Col-0 _phyD_ mutant during the CARA mission, as described by Paul et al. (2015). Our mathematical modeling revealed that this similarity in auxin distribution patterns may be responsible for the observed changes in growth patterns.

**Description of root shape modelling:** Adjusting the sensitivity settings for tropism within the Archidart modeling software indicates that alterations in root skew and waving can be initiated by reducing thigmo-tropism sensitivity. This finding suggests a potential correlation between environmental stressors, such as hypoxic conditions, and a decrease in thigmotropic sensitivity in plants. Our modeling results, in conjunction with observational data from plants cultivated in agar dishes on the International Space Station (ISS), support this hypothesis, providing a valuable insight into the adaptive responses of plants to stress conditions.
