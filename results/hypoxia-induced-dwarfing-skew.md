# Hypoxia-induced dwarfing skew

**Hypoixa and sucrose-induced ROS-skew:** A recent study employing RNA sequencing (RNAseq) has shed new light on the biological responses in plants (BRIC) to varying environmental stresses. Notably, the _BRIC19_ and _BRIC20_ projects have focused on the phenomena of hypoxia in darkness leading to a high light reactive oxygen species (ROS) response in _Arabidopsis thaliana_ strains WS and Col. This work builds upon the foundational research by Loreti et al. (2005), adding significant new insights, particularly the crucial role of SWEET transporters in plant stress responses. Follow-up investigation into ecotype variation in anoxia response. Root elongation rates show recovery rate is relative to the length of the anoxia experienced by the plant.&#x20;

**Anoxia and hypoxia experiment:** Plants were grown on standard media as described by Choi et al., (20XX), plates were then inserted into custom lids with valves attached that allow nitrogen gas to create an anoxic environment for 1, 2, or 3 hours. Plants were images during and after the anoxia treatment using a flatbed scanner recording images at 15min intervals. Nightingale plots were used to plot the direction of growth after hypoxia treatment. Follow-up experiments (Figure X,X) show response to anoxia assays show low oxygen can affect root length and growth trajectory. There is ecotype variation in the plants response to low oxygen and it is interesting to note that WS exhibit large skews in response to changes in oxygen availability and this may potentially be the cause of the skewing root behavior observed during the ABRS mission (GLDS-7). In addition, these data also show that Ler has a left-handed skew in response to low oxygen, a phenotypic response previously observed in the BRIC17 (Johnson et al., 20xx) and in the EMCS TROPI study (Vanderbrink et al., 20XX)

Comparison of GeneLAB varieties (Col-0, Ler-0, Cvi-0, WS-2) root elongation kinetics post 3 hours of anoxia treatment. WS-2 expressed the greatest root elongation, followed with Col-0, Cvi-0, and Ler-0. n = 7-16.
