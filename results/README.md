# Results:

Recent research has uncovered significant insights into the challenges plants face in space, specifically focusing on the reduction of root growth observed in spaceflight conditions. This phenomenon has been closely linked to alterations in auxin transportâ€”a critical hormone involved in plant growth and development. Moreover, comprehensive RNA sequencing efforts have highlighted a set of hormone-related genes that display differential expression when compared between spaceflight and Earth-based control conditions.

### Key Points from OSDR image analysis:

* **Responsiveness to Light:** The Col genotype exhibits the highest level of responsiveness to light treatments, indicating a genotype-dependent variation in light sensitivity across different root traits.
* **Effect of Gravity:** Gravity consistently affects all genotypes across most root traits, demonstrating a strong and uniform impact independent of genotype variations.
* **Genotype and Treatment Interaction:** There is a complex interplay between genotype and environmental treatments (including light and gravity), influencing all aspects of root development.
* **Root Development Influences:** Root development is governed by both the genetic makeup of the organism (genotype) and the environmental conditions it is exposed to (such as light and gravity), underscoring the multifaceted nature of root trait expression.

### Key Points of "Relevance of Skewing Data in Plant Research"

* **Skewed data in plant growth experiments:** The paper highlights the importance of considering data skewing (non-normal distribution) in plant research conducted in controlled environments like ABRS and VEGGIE systems. Careful analysis is needed to avoid misinterpretations.
* **Cytokinin research:** A 2021 study on cytokinins offers new insights into plant growth regulation, adding to the understanding of plant responses to stress.
* **Complexity of plant stress responses:** The research underlines the intricate nature of plant reactions to environmental stresses, emphasizing the crucial roles of transporters and regulators.
* **Advances in RNAseq and bioinformatics:** These advancements allow deeper exploration of the molecular mechanisms behind plant adaptations, opening doors for innovative agricultural and plant biology strategies.

### Key Findings from the Modeling Experiments

* **Auxin Transport Modeling:**
  * PIN transporters play a vital role in plant adaptation and development during spaceflight.
  * Auxin distribution patterns might explain light-related physiological changes observed in plants.
  * The study suggests a link between observed auxin distribution and growth patterns during spaceflight.



*   **Root Shape Modeling:**

    * Reduced thigmo-tropism sensitivity in the Archidart model can lead to altered root skewing and waving.
    * This suggests a potential connection between stress factors (like low oxygen) and decreased thigmotropic sensitivity in plants.
    * The modeling results, along with observations from the ISS, support this hypothesis, providing valuable insights into plant stress responses.

### Key Findings from the follow-up hypoxia and anoxia experiments



*   **Ecotype Variation in response to short term Anoxia exposure:**

    * A custom chamber with valves linked to N2 gas chamber were used to create an anoxic environment for varying durations (1, 2, or 3 hours).
    * WT Col-0 Root elongation rates after anoxia treatment show recovery depends on the anoxia duration and exceeding 4 hours caused the primary root tip to die.&#x20;
    * Different plant ecotypes (Col-0, WS, Cvi and Ler) exhibit varying adaptive responses to anoxia, with the WS ecotype being the fastest to slow its growth and the faster est to recover post anoxia.


* **Findings on the long-term exposure exposures of samples to Hypoxia:**
  * Follow-up experiments (Figure X, X - data on specific figures not provided) confirm that low oxygen affects root growth and direction.
  * Nightingale plots were used to analyze growth direction post-hypoxia treatment show the natural variation in skewing caused by hypoxia.&#x20;
  * WS plants show significant skewing (uneven growth) in response to oxygen changes, potentially explaining the root behaviour observed during the ABRS mission (GLDS-7).
  * Ler plants exhibit left-handed skew under low oxygen, similar to observations in BRIC17 (Johnson et al., 20xx) and EMCS TROPI studies (Vanderbrink et al., 20xx).
