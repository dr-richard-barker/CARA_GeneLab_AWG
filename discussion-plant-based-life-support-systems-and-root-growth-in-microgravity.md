# Discussion: Plant-Based Life Support Systems and Root Growth in Microgravity

The investigation into the effects of different light and gravity treatments on root volume indicates significant variations across genotypes and treatment conditions. Specific genotypes responded differently under varied environmental stresses, highlighting the critical role of genetic makeup in the adaptability and growth of plants. The study underscores the complexity of plant responses to environmental stimuli and the importance of targeted genetic and environmental research to understand plant physiology and development better. The study highlights the impact of microgravity on plant growth, particularly focusing on the reduced auxin transport observed during spaceflight. This phenomenon is potentially attributed to alterations in the cytoskeleton and cell wall structure. Crucially, the research underscores the significance of photomorphogenesis and auxin transport mechanisms in facilitating root development in microgravity environments. These findings are pivotal for the advancement of plant-based life support systems in long-duration space expeditions.

Statistical Analysis of Root Length Across Various Conditions for the purpose of this study was to examine the differences in average root length across different light and gravity treatments within the same genotype, as well as among different genotypes and treatment groups. Upon analysis, only the Columbia (Col) genotype showed a significant difference in average root length when exposed to varying light conditions, with a p-value less than 0.05. A significant difference in average root length was observed across all three genotypes when subjected to different light treatments, each yielding a p-value less than 0.05. Similarly, when the genotypes were subjected to varying gravity conditions, a significant difference in average root length was noted for both gravity treatments, with a p-value of 0.000609. The comparison between different genotypes revealed a notable variance in average root length, with the most pronounced difference observed between Ws (Wassilewskija) and Col. The analysis yielded a p-value of 0.0284. Among the various treatments, the Columbia genotype exposed to Flight Light conditions (Col-FLT-Light) was identified as having the most significant deviation in root length compared with most other treatments. An extensive comparison across all twelve treatment groups highlighted significant discrepancies in average root length, confirmed by a p-value of 3.35e-07. The statistical examination delineated noteworthy variations in root system development under distinct environmental conditions, genotypes, and their interactions. These findings contribute valuable insights towards understanding the adaptability and growth dynamics of plants subjected to different environmental stimulants.



### **Perspective from IAA transport modelling: Auxin transport in **_**Col-0-phyD**_** should more closely resemble WS in darkness and to a lesser extent in light.**

The original paper states that there isn’t a reduction in root length in any of the genotypes when all treatments are considered. Interestingly if the light and dark treatments are separated then the Col-0 roots are shorter in flight when grown in light and the _phyD_ roots have increased diameter in flight when grown in dark. These are 2 previously unseen phenotypes that may provide some clues about the potential influence of photomorphogenesis on plant architecture in microgravity. RNAseq shows upregulation of photosynthetic machinery, to increase the thylakoid number, may increase the efficiency of the dark reaction to process by products of anaerobic respiration and may even enable the roots to perform photosynthesis.

In an investigation focused on the role of gravity in auxin-mediated gravity-sensing systems within primary roots, studies utilizing Arabidopsis thaliana transgenic lines with GFP-reporter genes (pDR5r::GFP, pTAA1::TAA1-GFP, pSCR::SCR-GFP, and pARR5::GFP) conducted on the International Space Station (ISS) revealed that gravity does not influence the establishment of auxin gradients essential for primary root growth. Through comparisons of space-grown plants and Earth-based controls using the Light Microscopy Module (LMM) and confocal microscopy, the research found that despite the absence of gravitational cues, the "vertical" distribution of auxin in roots persists, suggesting gravity independence in the auxin-gradient system's formation. However, variations in cytokinin distribution between spaceflight and ground-based samples point to potential spaceflight-induced changes in cytokinin-associated root growth processes ([https://bidd.group/spacelid/study.php?sid=SLID-284](https://bidd.group/spacelid/study.php?sid=SLID-284)).
