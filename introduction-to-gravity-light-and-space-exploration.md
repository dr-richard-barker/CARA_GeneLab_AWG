**Title:** Modulation of Photomorphogenesis in Spaceflight Influences Root System Architecture

##

Plants depend on their roots for proper growth, with gravity critically shaping root structure. The process by which roots sense and respond to gravity involves two main models, both emphasizing the role of starch granules in initiating signal transduction upon gravity detection. Key signaling molecules such as indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), reactive oxygen species, and calcium ions play vital roles in this process, facilitating the downward growth of roots. Understanding these mechanisms, which involve complex interactions between starch, IAA, and calcium ions, not only advances our knowledge of plant root behavior in response to gravity but also sets the stage for further scientific exploration in plant biology.

This research aims to explore the impact of photomorphogenesis and auxin transport on root growth under microgravity conditions. Auxin, a pivotal plant hormone, plays a crucial role in various developmental stages, particularly in root expansion. Phytochromes, which detect light presence or absence, are integral in modulating downstream genes associated with auxin transport. Among the critical elements in photomorphogenesis, the phytochrome family serves as a key photoreceptor. Photomorphogenesis describes the adaptive growth and developmental responses of plants to light cues.

Root development is significantly influenced by light-regulated auxin signalling, involving key components like phytochromes, cryptochromes, phototropins, phytochrome-interacting factors, and COP1. These elements mediate various root growth aspects, including primary, lateral, and adventitious root formation, as well as root hair development and root branching, through the auxin signalling pathway. The mechanism underlying this regulation is complex, differing across species such as barley (_Hordeum vulgare_ L.) and wheat (_Triticum aestivum_ L.), and involves shifts in transcript levels and endogenous IAA content. This highlights the intricate relationship between light exposure and auxin in root development as a critical area for future horticultural research.



Recent studies focusing on the effects of spaceflight on plant growth have shown significant alterations in root system architecture due to changes in photomorphogenesis. Specifically, experimentation involving WT Col (wild type Columbia) has demonstrated a dwarfing effect that is notably absent in both Col-0-_phyD_ mutants and WS (Wassilewskija) mutants. These findings suggest a unique response to spaceflight conditions dependent on genetic variations related to the phytochrome D (phyD) gene.

### Exploring Plant Tropisms and Microgravity

Plants have evolved to thrive under the influence of gravity, which plays a pivotal role in several of their growth and development processes. These include auxin transportation and various tropisms—namely, gravitropism, thigmotropism, chemotropism, oxytropism, and hydrotropism. When grown in microgravity conditions, however, the absence of gravity can significantly alter these processes, affecting overall plant growth and development. Research into the effects of microgravity on plant development has highlighted significant alterations in auxin signaling and transport pathways. These adaptations are seemingly pivotal for plants to manage the unique stresses of spaceflight, including regions of reduced oxygen supply. The findings suggest that plants might engage components of their gravitropic response systems to counteract the challenges posed by microgravity, pointing to a sophisticated level of stress response that utilizes established physiological mechanisms.

### Gravitropism and Auxin: Understanding Plant Growth

Gravitropism has intrigued scientists since the 19th century, notably beginning with Thomas Andrew Knight's observation that plant roots grow towards the center of the earth regardless of the seed's initial orientation. This phenomenon underscores a plant's innate ability to orient its growth in response to gravity, a crucial survival mechanism. The distribution of Auxin, a crucial hormone for plant growth, is influenced by gravity and light, which guides the direction of growth in plants. The amount of Auxin present is directly linked to the rate at which roots and stems grow, with variations in its concentration across different plant parts. The Cholodny-Went model, developed from the early 20th-century research by Nikolai Cholodny and Frits Warmolt Went, significantly advanced the understanding of gravitropism, demonstrating how plants respond to gravity, with the identification of Auxin playing a central role in plant growth orientation.



### Auxin's Journey and Gravitropism

Auxin (Indole-3-acetic acid, IAA) is transported to the root tip, where it is then redistributed to the root cortex and epidermis. This redistribution is key for the elongation zone of the root, where Auxin regulates cell growth. When a root is aligned perpendicularly to the gravity vector, statolith sedimentation in root cap cells enables the plant to detect the gravity direction. This leads to the asymmetrical distribution of Auxin on the root’s lower side, inhibiting elongation and causing the root to bend towards the gravity vector. Charles Darwin's earlier work had hinted at the sensitivity of plant tips to gravity, noting that influence from the tip prompts the rest of the plant to curve downward. However, it was Cholodny and Went who offered a detailed model based on methodical experimental observations. Gravitropism, driven fundamentally by Auxin dynamics, illustrates plants' exquisite adaptation to their environment, navigating growth directions with the earth's gravitational pull as a guiding force.

### Auxin's Role in Gene Expression and Regulation of Root Growth

Auxins, pivotal plant hormones, play a critical role in regulating gene expression by influencing the interactions between their receptors (TIR1-containing proteins) and Aux/IAA repressor proteins. This leads to the ubiquitination and degradation of repressor proteins, enabling the transcription of genes with Auxin Responsive Elements (ARE). At lower concentrations of Auxin, repressor proteins inhibit gene expression, affecting processes like root growth.

Upon experiencing a gravity stimulus, Auxin distribution shifts, promoting higher concentrations in the lower root part. This increase in Auxin concentration enhances the expression of ARE-containing genes, thus modulating cell growth and elongation rates. This mechanism of regulation of Auxin-mediated gene transcription and the gravitropic curvature of root tips, respectively. The DII-VENUS degradation data, quantifying Auxin's effects on gene expression, offers a dose- and time-dependent perspective on how exogenous Auxin concentrations influence the DII-VENUS signal.

Notably, a mathematical model elucidates the dynamics of Auxin redistribution post-gravity stimulus, aligning with the empirical data. This model showcases varying profiles of Auxin distribution and identifies the optimal correlation with experimental results, reflecting on the scientific endeavour to quantify and understand Auxin's regulatory functions in plant physiology.

Auxin swiftly redistributes within 5 minutes following a gravity stimulus, leading to root bending within approximately 10-20 minutes, aligning with its role in regulating root curvature. Notably, Auxin levels equalize around 100 minutes post-stimulus, coinciding with a root tip bending angle of circa 40°, suggesting a tipping point mechanism at this curvature degree. Subsequent phases involve the synthesis of Auxin response targets, indicating a complex regulatory framework for gravity-induced root bending. The employment of the DII-VENUS reporter alongside a mathematical model highlights the dynamic Auxin redistribution process, offering valuable kinetic insights. The model simplification to a single differential equation from initially four underscored the quasi-steady state assumption's effectiveness in capturing essential dynamics of Auxin-mediated responses.

In recent years, the application of systems biology and mathematical modelling to plant biology has led to the emergence of systems biology. _Arabidopsis thaliana_ has emerged as a model system for these investigations due to its small genome and well-understood genetics.  SimuPlant Client is a program to visualise and interact with vertex-based models running on the SimuPlant Server. This download section is for SimuPlant: The Virtual Root, which features multi-cellular models of auxin transport within the _Arabidopsis_ root tip (Band et al., (XXXX)).
