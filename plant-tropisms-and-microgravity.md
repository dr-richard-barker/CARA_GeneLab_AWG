# Plant Tropisms and Microgravity

Plants have evolved to thrive under the influence of gravity, which plays a pivotal role in several of their growth and development processes. These include auxin transportation and various tropismsâ€”namely, gravitropism, thigmotropism, chemotropism, oxytropism, and hydrotropism. When grown in microgravity conditions, however, the absence of gravity can significantly alter these processes, affecting overall plant growth and development. Research into the effects of microgravity on plant development has highlighted significant alterations in auxin signaling and transport pathways. These adaptations are seemingly pivotal for plants to manage the unique stresses of spaceflight, including regions of reduced oxygen supply. The findings suggest that plants might engage components of their gravitropic response systems to counteract the challenges posed by microgravity, pointing to a sophisticated level of stress response that utilizes established physiological mechanisms.

**Add information with about physiology in EMCS experiments?**&#x20;

**"**Under the conditions of microgravity, a novel positive blue-light phototropic response was observed in roots of seedlings. While blue-light-based negative phototropism in roots has been extensively characterized in ground studies ([Correll and Kiss 2002](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5748516/#R12)), this positive phototropic response is greatly reduced at 0.1_g_, and effectively negated at 0.3_g_ and higher gravity levels. To date, this phototropic response has not previously been observed in the roots of _Arabidopsis_."&#x20;

Need help from Joshua and Christina i think?
