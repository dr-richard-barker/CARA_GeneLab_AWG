**Title:** Modulation of Photomorphogenesis in Spaceflight Influences Root System Architecture

**Abstract:** Photomorphogenesis and auxin transport are important processes= that regulate root growth in plants. We investigated the role of these processes in root growth in microgravity by growing Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings in spaceflight or ground control conditions under light or dark conditions. Root growth was measured at various time points. RNA sequencing was used to identify genes that were differentially expressed in the spaceflight and ground control conditions. Mathematical modeling was used to simulate the effects of auxin transport on root growth. Our results showed that root growth was significantly reduced in spaceflight compared to ground control conditions for WT Col-0, but this reduction in root growth was more pronounced in seedlings that were grown under light conditions. RNA sequencing identified a number of genes that were differentially expressed in the spaceflight vs ground control conditions in both light and dark-grown samples. These genes included genes involved in auxin transport, sucrose, amino acid, hormone transport, photomorphogenesis, and cell signalling revealing that the addition of light enables more cellular and molecular adaptations to the effects of spaceflight. Mathematical modelling using PIN protein expression changes showed that the reduction in auxin accumulation in columella and lateral root caps of spaceflight samples explains the changes in root length and diameter. These results suggest that photomorphogenesis and auxin transport play important roles in root growth in microgravity. The reduction in auxin transport in spaceflight may be due to a number of factors, including changes in the cytoskeleton, cell wall structure and PIN protein expression. The results of this study have implications for the design of future plant-based life support systems for long-duration spaceflight.

#### Asymmetry in Plant Growth Responses: Earth vs. Space

* **Asymmetry in Flight Conditions:** Plants exposed to conditions of flight exhibit a notable lack of symmetry, demonstrating a tendency towards becoming shorter and fatter. This morphological change is indicative of alterations in the plant hormone auxin, which plays a crucial role in regulating plant growth and behavior.
* **Hypoxia/Anoxia Conditions:** Similar morphological changes—specifically, becoming shorter and fatter—are observed in plants subjected to hypoxia (low oxygen) or anoxia (absence of oxygen). This condition also leads to skewing, suggesting a shared stress response mechanism between ground-based hypoxia/anoxia conditions and those encountered during spaceflight.
* **Spaceflight-Induced Skewing and Curling:** The observed skewing and curling of plants in spaceflight can be attributed to hypoxia-induced stress. Given the parallels in plant responses to ground-based hypoxia and the conditions experienced during spaceflight, it is plausible to conclude that the unique stresses of the space environment, including altered oxygen availability, are a significant factor in inducing these growth patterns.
