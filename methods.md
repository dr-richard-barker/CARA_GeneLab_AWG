# Methods:

In this study, we investigate the role of the PIN auxin transporter during spaceflight and translate environmental signals, such as light or dark, into changes in growth patterns. Additionally, we use mathematical modeling to study the effects of this transporter on Arabidopsis growth patterns during the CARA mission. Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings were grown in spaceflight or ground control conditions under light or dark conditions. Root growth was measured at various time points. RNA sequencing was used to identify genes that were differentially expressed in the spaceflight and ground control conditions. Mathematical modeling was used to simulate the effects of auxin transport on root growth.&#x20;

### Mathematical Modeling of Auxin Transport

This study focused on the significant role of PIN transporters in the distribution patterns of auxin within Arabidopsis during spaceflight conditions. The conductivity values assigned to the cell walls were based on the tissue-specific expression levels of the PIN proteins, which were meticulously detailed in Table X. Python's Jupyter Notebook environment facilitated the computational modelling, enhancing our understanding of auxin transport mechanisms.

### Reanalysis of LSDA Images by GeneLab plant AWG

This document details an advanced pipeline designed for the systematic exploration of complex image data, with a special focus on the analysis of root orientation. The workflow integrates data acquisition from ALSDA, alignment with Adobe Bridge Image Raw, quantification via SmartRoot Fiji plugin, and sophisticated analysis and visualization through ArchiDart in RStudio. By applying dimensionality reduction techniques such as MDS and PCA, the approach uncovers patterns within the dataset, enhancing understanding of the root systems. The CARA pipeline further refines this analysis by examining skeletonized versions of the raw data, focusing on root orientation through nightingale plots. These plots provide insightful visualizations of spatial distribution and orientation density, offering a clear depiction of root structures. Through a mix of image processing, quantitative analysis, and innovative visualization methods, the pipeline provides a deep dive into root architectures, uncovering now phenoypes providing distinct responses for each ecotype and genotypes showing that light modulation of photomorphogneisis of the shoot and the resultsing duel effect on root growth  patterns is important for understanding plant establishment in microgravity.
