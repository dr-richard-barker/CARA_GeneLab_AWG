# Conclusion:

## Significant Impact of Light Absence on Plant adaption to spaceflight&#x20;

Modulation of Photomorphogenesis in Spaceflight Influences Root System Architecture (Ref). Data for this study was collected from the Advanced Biological Research System (ABRS) and the CARA (Commercial and Academic Research Announcement) mission. By employing deep learning techniques to analyze image data, researchers have garnered new insights into how altered light conditions in space affect plant growth. The absence of the dwarfing effect in Col-0-_phyD_ and WS mutants highlights the critical role of phyD in plant adaptation to spaceflight, opening avenues for further research into genetic modifications that could enable more robust plant growth in extraterrestrial environments. Plants are crucial for bioregenerative life-support systems in human space missions, necessitating resilience and adaptability to various gravity levels, including microgravity in space and partial gravity (partial-_g_) on the Moon or Mars. Gravity significantly influences plant growth and development through gravitropism. Studies have shown that plants undergo stress responses, including cellular changes and gene expression alterations, under microgravity and partial-_g_. Research conducted on the International Space Station (ISS) and on Earth has used seedlings and cell cultures to investigate these effects (Ref's and improve from Raul's work).



Plants undergo significant adaptations in amino acid metabolism and transport in the absence of light. These adjustments are crucial for their survival and growth under such conditions. This study has demonstrated the importance of photomorphogenesis and auxin transport in root growth in microgravity. A combination of environmental and genetic systems can be used to taylor plant architecture in microgravity. The results of this study have implications for the design of future plant-based life support systems for long-duration spaceflight. The presence of light powers a circadian transport of Auxin in the root tip following the reverse fountain model (Swarup et al., 205), the photomorphogenesis enables a plethora of adaptive responses to spaceflight. The secondary biproducts of root metabolism, microgravity-induced root photosynthesis has the potential to change the root morphology making them growth either shorter or wider in diameter. The results of these studies have shown that microgravity can have a significant impact on plant growth and development. This is important information for scientists who are developing plant-based life support systems for long-duration spaceflight.



In conclusion, the morphological changes observed in plants during spaceflight, such as skewing and curling, are strongly linked to the stress induced by hypoxia, mirroring similar responses seen under terrestrial hypoxic or anoxic conditions. This suggests a fundamental stress response mechanism deeply influenced by changes in oxygen availability, whether in space or on Earth. The notable asymmetry and altered growth patterns—plants becoming shorter and thicker—emphasize the impact of altered auxin distribution or activity under flight conditions. These findings underscore the profound effect of the space environment on plant physiology, highlighting the necessity of further research to understand and mitigate these effects for future space exploration and agriculture.

### Key Findings:



**Key Points from OSDR Image Reanalysis:**

* **Light Sensitivity Varies by Genotype:** The Col genotype responds most strongly to light, highlighting genetic differences in root response to light.
* **Gravity Affects All Genotypes:** Gravity consistently impacts root development across all studied genotypes, regardless of genetic makeup.
* **Genotype and Environment Interact:** Both genetics (genotype) and surrounding conditions (light and gravity) influence root development in complex ways.
* **Root Development is Multifaceted:** Root traits are determined by both an organism's genetic makeup and the environment it experiences.



**Key Points from "Relevance of Skewing Data in Plant Research"**

* **Sucrose from the shoots stress the hypoxic stress Response:** Differential regulation of SWEET transports contributing to our understanding of plant hypoxic response mechanisms.
* **Complex Stress Responses:** Plant reactions to spaceflight environmental stresses are complex as, involve numerous environmental factors and can adjust transporters and transcriptional regulators.
* **Advanced RNAseq analysis techniques provide Deeper Insights:** Advancements in RNAseq and bioinformatics enable a deeper exploration of the molecular mechanisms behind plant adaptations, paving the way for innovative agricultural and plant biology strategies.



**Key Findings from the Auxin Modeling Experiments**

* **PIN Transporters are crucial for regulating auxin distribution:** These transporters play a vital role in plant adaptation and development during spaceflight.
* **Auxin Distribution effect root physiology:** Auxin distribution patterns may explain physiological changes observed in plants under light exposure.
* **Auxin and Growth Patterns:** The study suggests a link between observed to changes in auxin distribution and plant growth patterns during spaceflight.



**Modelling supported by changes in root shape:**

* **Thigmo-tropism and Root Shape:** Reduced sensitivity to thigmo-tropism (touch response) in the model can lead to altered root skewing and waving.
* **Stress and Thigmo-tropism:** This suggests a potential connection between stress factors (like low oxygen) and decreased thigmotropic sensitivity in plants.
* **Modelling Supports Hypothesis:** The modeling results, along with observations from the ISS, support the link between stress-induced reduction in gravitropism and increased sensitivity to thigmo-tropic stimuli contributing to root skewing in spaceflight. &#x20;
